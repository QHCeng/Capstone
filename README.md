# Forecasting Customer Financial Behavior using LSTM  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the use of **deep learning models (LSTM/GRU)** to forecast customer financial behavior, such as income changes, balance depletion, and potential financial stress.  

Banks and financial institutions face challenges in scaling forecasting models from segment-level insights (e.g., age groups, income tiers) to **millions of individualized customer forecasts**. This project simulates that trade-off by comparing traditional time series models with advanced neural network approaches.  

## 🎯 Goals  
1. **Segment-Level Forecasting (Baseline)**  
   - Create time-indexed series grouped by customer segments (e.g., income tier, age group).  
   - Apply **ARIMA**, **Exponential Smoothing**, and **Prophet** models.  
   - Visualize and evaluate baseline forecasting performance.  

2. **Customer-Level Forecasting with LSTM/GRU**  
   - Engineer time-series sequences per customer (e.g., past N months of balances or income).  
   - Train **LSTM/GRU models** across customer-level sequences.  
   - Compare predictive accuracy and generalization against baseline models.  

## 📊 Dataset  
Due to limitations in sharing private banking data, this project leverages **public datasets**. For example:  
- [Bank Customer Transaction Analysis (Kaggle)]

**Data Details:**  
- **Type:** Time series (balances, income, transactions)  
- **Focus:** Checking and savings products (extendable to other customer-level data)  

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Scraping (API-based if applicable)  
   - Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering  
   - Handling missing data and outliers  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualization of financial behavior trends  
   - Segment analysis for baseline forecasting  

3. **Modeling**  
   - **Phase 1:** Segment-level forecasting with ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet  
   - **Phase 2:** Customer-level forecasting with LSTM/GRU
   -  
## 🚀 Expected Outcome
  - A validated LSTM model capable of forecasting individualized customer behavior.
  - Benchmark comparisons between statistical models and deep learning approaches.
  - Visual dashboards to illustrate segment-level and customer-level forecasts.
